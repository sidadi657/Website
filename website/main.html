            Various environment protection programs are being practised at the individual, organizational and government levels with the aim of establishing a balance between man and the environment.<br /><br />Some of the current environmental

          <h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
          <p>
            Climate change usually refers to the shifts in things like precipitation, wind patterns, and temperatures over a given period.
            Measured changes in climate could last a few years, decades, or even millions of years.<span class="dots">...</span>

        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>Causes</h3>
          <p>
            The American Association for the Advancement of Science has stated,
            “The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now,
            and it is a growing threat to society.”<br />
            Below are a few of the ways humans are accelerating climate change-<br />
            <br />
            1)<b>Greenhouse Gases</b>-Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap the reflected energy,
            redirecting it back down to the earth and eventually contributing to global warming.
            </br />
            </br />

            2)<b>Deforestation</b>-Deforestation and climate change often go hand in hand.
            Not only does climate change increase deforestation by way of wildfires and other extreme weather,
            but deforestation is also a major contributor to global warming.
            </br />
            </br />
            3)<b>Human Activity</b>-The most significant contributor to climate change in the United States is the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.
            Of these factors, transportation in the form of cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes
            emits the largest percentage of CO2–speeding up global warming and remaining a significant cause of climate change.

          <h3>Effects </h3>
          <p>
            While the long-term consequences are still to be seen, for now,
            climate change continues to cause extreme weather as well as safety and economic challenges on a global scale.
            <br />
            <br />
            1)<b>Extreme Weather</b>-Changes to weather are perhaps the most noticeable effect of climate change for the average person. <br />
            Extreme weather influenced by climate change includes:


          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stronger storms & hurricanes</li>
            <li>Heatwaves</li>
            <li>Wildfires</li>
            <li>More flooding</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            1)<b>Negative Impact in Ecosystems</b>-Ecosystems are interconnected webs of living organisms that help support all kinds of plant and biological life.
            Climate change is already changing seasonal weather patterns and disrupting food distribution for plants and animals throughout the world,
            potentially causing mass extinction events.
            Some studies estimate that nearly 30% of plant and animal species are at risk of extinction if global temperatures continue to rise.

      <h2>Water Pollution</h2>

        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>What is Water Pollution?</h3>
          <p>
            The introduction of harmful substances into rivers, oceans, lakes and ponds, which changes the physical, chemical or biological condition of the water is called water pollution.
            The polluted water lacks oxygen and therefore the organisms die.<span class="dots">...</span>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide more">
        <div class="text-box">
          <h3>Causes</h3>
          <p>
            Many of our waterways are in poor biological condition. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
            46% of U.S. streams, 21% of lakes, 18% of coastal waters, and 32% of the nation’s
            wetlands are contaminated by water pollution.<br />
            Below are a few of the causes of Water Pollution-<br />
            <br />
            1)<b>Untreated Sewage</b>-Untreated sewage kills 2.2 million people each year worldwide from diarrheal diseases.In the U.S. 4.32 million people suffer from acute gastrointestinal
            illness from contaminated public drinking water systems.In India,Chemical contamination of water, mainly through fluoride and arsenic, is present in 1.96 million dwellings.
            These diseases stem from untreated sewage, which allows pathogens to grow and reduces the amount of oxygen in the water.
            </br />
            </br />

            2)<b>Ocean Acidification</b>-Shellfish and coral reefs suffer serious damage from ocean acidification, also caused by global warming.
            Scientists estimate 25% of all carbon emitted goes into the oceans.The increase in carbon dioxide changes the chemical makeup of the water.
            This, in turn, causes the pH levels to fall, making the water more acidic.Since the 1800s,there has been a 30% increase in water
            acidity.This is an alarming trend that creates a toxic environment for ocean wildlife.
            </br />
            </br />
            3)<b>Human Activity</b>-The most significant contributor to climate change in the United States is the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.
            Of these factors, transportation in the form of cars, trucks, ships, trains, and planes
            emits the largest percentage of CO2–speeding up global warming and remaining a significant cause of climate change.
